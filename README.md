`📝 How it works:`
<br><br>
The generator generates unlocked Discord tokens, and has an optional option to email verify them (free of cost) using a private GMail API. Of course, all of the tokens are unlocked and can be used for Mass DMing and other purposes. The generator is very fast, generating tokens up to 1,000 / second and works best with datacenter proxies. It uses a variety of factors to achieve this such as anti TLS fingerprinting, solving cloudflare challenges to bypass hCaptcha's anti bot detection, and more!

`🤖 Captcha solving:`
<br><br>
The generator has a built-in **hCaptcha AI solver** meaning you won't have to pay for any third-parties to solve captchas for you. It has a feature to detect new captchas and has a 99.9% solving rate. It also has an undetectable motion data which contributes to the unlock rate.

> **Note** I have already created over a million tokens with this generator. As I have no more use for it, I've decided to give it back to the community since I quit selling Discord tokens.
